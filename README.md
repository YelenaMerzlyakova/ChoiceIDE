## My Choice of IDE

There are other IDE's that have caught my eye like *PHPStorm* and *Sublime*. PHPStorm was too expensive and mostly used for backend and I've used sublime before so I prefer to try something new. 

In the end I have decided to go with **Visual Studio** because I have read that it's mostly used by Frontend Devs, something that I aspire to do in the future. It also seems that it's one of the easiest tools to use. Easy tools for simple code will be the motto to go by. :smirk:
